# Yard Bot
Yard Bot is a Raspberry Pi program that controls a robot designed to automate various yard work tasks, including mowing the lawn, raking leaves, and plowing snow. This project aims to provide a convenient and efficient solution for maintaining outdoor spaces, reducing manual labor, and enhancing the overall yard maintenance experience.

## Features
- **Lawn Mowing**: Yard Bot is equipped with a robotic mower that autonomously navigates and mows the lawn, ensuring a well-manicured yard without the need for manual intervention.
